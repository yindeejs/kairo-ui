# Publishing Kairo

This repo is fully prepared to publish `@kairo-ui/theme` and `@kairo-ui/react`
to npm — the steps below are the handful of things only a human with the
right credentials can do. Everything else (build, typecheck, test, lint,
changelogs, CI, release automation) is already wired up.

Both packages are a [Changesets **fixed** group](.changeset/config.json)
(`fixed: [["@kairo-ui/theme", "@kairo-ui/react"]]`), so they always version
and release together, and both publish with `--access public`. The count of
pending changesets changes as work lands, so don't trust a hardcoded number
here — run this instead:

```bash
pnpm changeset status
```

The pending changesets should produce the `v0.1.0` milestone release.

## 0. Prerequisites (one-time, human-only)

1. **Reserve the npm scope.** `@kairo-ui` is unclaimed as of 2026-07-17 but
   this was **not re-verified today** — check before you rely on it:
   ```bash
   npm view @kairo-ui/react
   npm view @kairo-ui/theme
   ```
   If both 404, the scope is free. Reserve it either by:
   - Creating an npm **organization** named `kairo-ui` at
     https://www.npmjs.com/org/create (recommended — lets you add
     maintainers later), or
   - Simply publishing the first package under your own npm user once
     you're a member of a `kairo-ui` org/scope (npm creates scoped packages
     under an org or user scope; a bare user account can't own an
     arbitrary `@kairo-ui` scope without the org).
2. **Log in locally** (needed for the manual path below):
   ```bash
   npm login
   ```

## Option A — Manual local publish

Use this the first time, or anytime you want full control over the release.

```bash
# 1. Turn the pending changesets into version bumps + CHANGELOGs.
pnpm changeset version

# 2. Review the diff: package.json versions, CHANGELOG.md files, and that
#    the pending changeset files under .changeset/ were deleted.
git diff

# 3. Build once more against the bumped versions and publish both packages.
pnpm build
pnpm publish -r --access public
```

`pnpm publish -r` publishes every workspace package that isn't `private`.
Today that's exactly `packages/theme` and `packages/react` — `apps/docs`
and `tooling/tsconfig` are `"private": true` as you'd expect, and so is
`packages/motion-react`, but *not* because it isn't publishable: it's a
working, tested package that's deliberately held back from the v0.1.0
publish. Don't flip its `private` flag just because
`-r` would otherwise skip it — that's the whole point of the flag. `--access
public` is required because scoped packages (`@kairo-ui/*`) default to
private otherwise.

**2FA note:** if the npm account/org enforces two-factor auth for
publishing, this manual path prompts for an OTP interactively and can't be
scripted or run unattended. If that's the case, use Option B instead — npm
**Automation** tokens (the type step 1 of Option B tells you to generate)
are exempt from the OTP prompt, which is exactly why the release workflow
asks for that token type specifically. Prefer Option B unless you have a
concrete reason to publish by hand.

Commit and push the version bump / changelog changes (and tag, if you want)
after publishing.

## Option B — Automated release via GitHub Actions

Use this for ongoing releases once the repo is on GitHub.

> **Heads-up on npm auth (checked July 2026).** npm has been phasing out
> long-lived *classic* tokens (the old "Automation" type among them) in favour
> of two things: **granular access tokens** and **trusted publishing** (OIDC —
> tokenless auth straight from GitHub Actions, with provenance generated
> automatically). If a plain "Automation token" is no longer offered or is
> rejected, generate a **granular access token** scoped to publish `@kairo-ui/*`
> instead — everything else below is unchanged, it still lands in the same
> `NPM_TOKEN` secret. Trusted publishing is the better long-term setup but it
> wants the package to already exist (you configure it against a published
> package on npmjs.com), so it's the path to switch to *after* the first
> release, not for `0.1.0`. `release.yml` already requests `id-token: write`
> and both packages set `publishConfig.provenance`, so this first token-based
> publish still gets a provenance attestation.

1. **Add the `NPM_TOKEN` repo secret**: npm → Access Tokens → generate a token
   with **publish** access to `@kairo-ui/*` (a **granular access token**, or an
   **Automation** token if your account still offers one — see the heads-up
   above) → GitHub repo → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → New
   repository secret → name it `NPM_TOKEN`. A token that is exempt from the
   interactive OTP prompt is what lets the workflow publish unattended — see
   the 2FA note under Option A for why.
2. **Enable "Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests"**:
   GitHub repo → Settings → Actions → General → Workflow permissions. This
   was off, which made every run of `release.yml` fail with `GitHub Actions
   is not permitted to create or approve pull requests` while looking like
   an npm/token problem — it has since been enabled on this repo, but if
   you're setting this up fresh (fork, new org, etc.) check it first.
3. **Push to `main`** (or merge a PR into it). [`.github/workflows/release.yml`](.github/workflows/release.yml)
   runs on every push to `main` and, via [`changesets/action@v1`](https://github.com/changesets/action):
   - If there are pending changesets, it opens/updates a **"Version
     Packages"** pull request with the version bumps and CHANGELOG entries
     already applied (nothing is published yet).
   - Once that PR is merged (so no changesets remain), the next run
     publishes to npm by executing the root `release` script
     (`pnpm build && changeset publish`), using `NPM_TOKEN` for npm auth
     and the built-in `GITHUB_TOKEN` to open the PR / create GitHub
     releases.
4. No further action needed after that — repeat step 3 for every future
   release (add changesets via `pnpm changeset` as you land user-facing
   changes, merge the resulting Version Packages PR when ready to ship).

## Notes

- [`.github/workflows/ci.yml`](.github/workflows/ci.yml) runs
  install/build/typecheck/test/lint on every push and pull request — it
  does not publish anything.
- CSS minification (Lightning CSS) is **not** out of scope — it's already
  wired into the build. `@kairo-ui/theme`'s
  `exports["./styles.css"]` and `exports["./tokens.css"]` now point at
  `dist/styles.css` / `dist/tokens.css`, generated by `pnpm build`
  (`tsdown` then `scripts/build-css.mjs`). This means **`pnpm build` must
  run before every publish** — Option A does this explicitly (step 3) and
  Option B's `release` script does too (`pnpm build && changeset publish`),
  but if you ever publish some other way, skipping the build ships a
  package whose `./styles.css` export points at a `dist/` file that either
  doesn't exist or is stale.
- Neither workflow nor this guide runs `npm publish`/`pnpm publish`
  automatically without the steps above — publishing always requires the
  `NPM_TOKEN` secret (Option B) or a logged-in human (Option A).
