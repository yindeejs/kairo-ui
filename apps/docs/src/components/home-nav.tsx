/**
 * The landing page's top bar.
 *
 * The page does not use `HomeLayout`, so this carries everything that layout's
 * header used to: section links plus the theme, locale and repository
 * controls. Keeping the layout only for its header meant GitHub appeared twice
 * — once in the header, once as the bar's end cap — and the brand was
 * duplicated against the pinned pane's own wordmark.
 *
 * The segments are plain links, not tab panels: they navigate to other pages
 * rather than swapping content in place, so real anchors keep them crawlable
 * and middle-clickable.
