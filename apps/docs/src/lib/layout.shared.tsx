 * Top-level header nav.
 *
 * These are plain links rather than Fumadocs' derived sidebar tabs. Tabs are
 * built from *child folders* marked `root: true`, so the loose top-level pages
 * (Installation / Theming / Motion) can never form a tab of their own — the
 * only tab that could exist was a lone "Components", which also duplicated the
 * folder already shown in the sidebar. A single tab is worse than none, and
 * foldering the guides purely to manufacture a second tab would churn every
 * `/docs/*` URL. Links give the same header row honestly.
